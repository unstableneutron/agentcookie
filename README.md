# agentcookie

Peer-to-peer Chrome session replication for AI agents.

Your laptop is logged in to everything. Your AI agents run on a different machine (Mac mini, cloud VM, whatever) and aren't. That gap is `agentcookie`.

## Why

Existing that skill tools are built for humans switching accounts between two laptops they both touch. They assume someone will click "Merge" or open Chrome periodically. agentcookie is built for the opposite workflow: continuous, one-way, unattended replication from the machine you live in to the machine your AI agents act from. No browser required on the sink. No third-party data plane. Pairing-derived keys, allowlists on both sides.

## Status

Pre-release. v0.1 in active development. Watch the repo for the launch announcement.

### What works today

- Unified `agentcookie` CLI: `source`, `sink`, `pair`, `status`, `version`. All support `--json` for agent callers.
- Pairing handshake: X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 salted with a one-time code. Derived 32-byte keys land at `~/.config/agentcookie/keys/<peer>.json` mode 0600.
- Cookie acquisition on macOS: read Chrome cookies SQLite read-only with `immutable=1`, decrypt v10 ciphertext using the Keychain Safe Storage key.
- Cookie write: schema-aware INSERT ... ON CONFLICT that adapts to Chrome's evolving column set (`top_frame_site_key`, `source_type`, `has_cross_site_ancestor`).
- Live-Chrome injection: sink probes Chrome's DevTools port and uses `Storage.setCookies` for instant in-memory visibility. Falls back to SQLite write if Chrome isn't debuggable.
- Wire protocol v1: versioned `SyncEnvelope` with monotonic Sequence (replay defense), source hostname, cookies. Documented in `docs/protocol.md`.
- Sink-side allowlist enforcement: defense in depth even if the source is compromised.
- AES-256-GCM transport over HTTP, layered on top of the Tailscale tailnet's WireGuard channel.
- 42 unit tests across `internal/chrome`, `internal/transport`, `internal/config`, `internal/keystore`, `internal/pairing`, `internal/cdp`, `internal/protocol`.

### What's coming

- Long-lived watch mode (fsnotify-driven continuous sync). Today `agentcookie source --once` covers the cron / launchd loop.
- macOS Keychain storage for derived keys. Today the keys live in `~/.config/agentcookie/keys/` at mode 0600.
- `agentcookie pair --rotate` for live key rotation.
- Durable replay defense (nonce or timestamp window in the envelope).
- One-to-many fan-out.
- Linux sink support.

## Quickstart

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for the full five-minute install. Short version:

```
go install github.com/mvanhorn/agentcookie/cmd/agentcookie@latest
# Drop ~/.config/agentcookie/source.yaml + allowlist.yaml on laptop
# Drop ~/.config/agentcookie/sink.yaml + allowlist.yaml on Mac mini
agentcookie pair --as source     # on laptop, prints code
agentcookie pair --as sink ...   # on Mac mini, with the code
agentcookie sink                 # long-lived on Mac mini
agentcookie source --once        # one-shot sync on laptop (cron this)
```
